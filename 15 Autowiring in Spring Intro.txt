Why autowiring?
automatic dependency injection
less code

Disadvantage: cant use for primitive/string 

a.1) 	What is autowiring?
	Spring feature where spring injects dependencies automatically

how we did till now? manually
	<ref bean=""/> 
	//spring container picked this reference from config file



a.2) What to provide spring? tell which type of dependency, which name,
	Spring container will link up and put object on its own


a.3) What disadvantage? not used for primitive/string
	can only use for object


Good: we only deal in moving objects	


for ex 
If A class is dependent on B (for object)
 
linking both = wiring

Autowiring

spring container automatically find dependency.

find how? by type/name etc


How to do Auto Wiring?
1) xml

2) annotations
==========================================================================

a) XML:

Autowiring modes

  a.1) no	: autowiring not enabled
 
  a.2) byName : search dependency and inject by bean name

  a.3) byType : search dependency and inject by type

  a.4) constructor : call constructor to inject dependency 

  a.5) autodetect : //depricated from Spring 3



b) Annotations

  b.1) @Autowired
