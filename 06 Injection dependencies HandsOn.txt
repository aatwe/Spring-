a) Ex of 2 dependent classes

class Student

{
int id;
sumgname;
Address address;

}


b) 

class Address

{
String street;
String city;
String state;
String country;

}


b) What Spring IOC container does? What is dependency injection

b.1) creates Address class address object

b.2) sets the Address class member variable values at runtime

b.3) Creates Student class object
	
b.4) injects Student class member variables

b.5) Inject address object in Address address at runtime automatically


-----Once all dependencies injected at runtime------

b.6) IOC Output: Student object

ConclusiON: all dependency management and creation done by IOC container.



c) how to do dependency injection? uses setter methods to initialize objects

c.1) Using Setter Injection/Property injection

setter methods called at runtime
class Student
{
	id,name,address
	set|d(id){}
	setName(name){}
	setAddress(address){}

}

class Address
{
	street,city,state,ccuntry

	setStreet(street)
	setEity(city)
	setState(state)
	setCountry(country)

l

c.2) using Constructor injection : Uses constructor to initialize objects
						  constructor -> takes values from config file
						  object created first, then constructor called
Student object created
address object created
address constructor called
Student constructor called

					
-------------
class Student 

{
String id,name,address;
Student(id,name,address)
{
}

}

class Address

{
String street,city,state,country:

Â° Address(street,city,state,cuuntry)
{
}

}



How to specify c.1 or c.2? config file

class names, properties, way: c.1 or c.2
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++===

d) 
d.1) What are config file? beans and dependencies declared (xml file)

For ex Hibernate config file: specifies all settings for Hibernate 

Spring: xml file


What are beans? class provided to ioc container


<beans>
  <bean>

</beans>
	 

d.2) supports what types of dependency injection?
Primitive Type
byte,short,char,int,float,double,long boolean 

Collection Type
List, Set, Map, Properties


Reference Type
Other class Object
